Blog Server Application(Spring + Angular)
This is a Spring Boot-based blog server that allows users to create and manage blog posts. The server is integrated with a MySQL database for data persistence.

Features
Post Entity: Stores blog posts with attributes such as content, author name, tags, image, date, and metadata like view and like counts.
Create Post API: Allows users to create a blog post by sending a POST request with the post's content and metadata.
MySQL Database Integration: Stores all blog post data in a MySQL database for permanent storage.
Post Entity
The Post entity is a JPA entity that maps to the blog posts stored in the database. It includes:

id: Unique identifier for each post (auto-generated).
name: Title of the blog post.
content: The main body of the blog post (with a maximum length of 5000 characters).
postedBy: The author of the post.
img: An image associated with the post.
date: The date when the post was published.
likeCount and viewCount: Keep track of the number of likes and views for the post.
tags: A list of tags associated with the post to categorize it.
API Endpoints
Create a New Post
POST /api/posts

Request Body: JSON object with the post's data (title, content, author, etc.).
Response: Returns the created post with a 201 status code upon success. In case of server errors, it returns a 500 status code.

Configuration
The application is connected to a MySQL database. The application.properties file includes the database configuration:
Database URL: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/blog_server connects to a MySQL database named blog_server.
Username and Password: Default credentials (root/root).
Hibernate Settings: Auto-updates the database schema based on the Post entity. SQL statements are logged for debugging.
